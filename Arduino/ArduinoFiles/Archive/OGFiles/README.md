# OG Files
The .ino located here is the original code run on all prototype board flights and calibration runs. The .ZIP files are the non-standard libraries required for this file before modification to work with the Teensy 4.1. 

View these as the "gold standard" we are attempting to achieve with the Teensy 4.1, saved here in an un-modified state for reference, both in performance comparisons and for flights using the prototype boards (now considered legacy hardware).
